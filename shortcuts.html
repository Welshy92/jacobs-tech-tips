            <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Keyboard shortcuts are a combination of keys pressed simultaneously to perform certain tasks. Using keyboard shortcuts in your day to day use can reduce the amount of time it takes to do tasks. This is especially helpful while working but is still useful in most cases. Some shortcuts are restricted to certain operating systems (OS for short) or software but a lot of what is shown below has multiple uses.</p>

            <h3>Word Processing</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The following shortcuts are commonly used to perform certain word processing tasks. These are particularly useful when moving things from 1 part of a document to another, or a different document entirely.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>CTRL + A</em> - Select all - This will select all content in a given area. For a normal document this will be the entire document. Can be used within most software and areas of your OS.</li>
                <li><em>CTRL + C</em> - Copy - This will copy any selected content to your clipboard. By default you can only have 1 item on your clipboard at a time, but the <em>WINDOWS + V</em> shortcut can be used to change that. Can be used within most software and areas of your OS.</li>
                <li><em>CTRL + X</em> - Cut - This has exactly the same functionality as copy, with the addition of removing the selected content from its original location when you <em>paste</em> it somewhere. Can be used within most software and areas of your OS.</li>
                <li><em>CTRL + V</em> - Paste - This will place whatever is on your clipboard into the selected location. Can be used within most software and areas of your OS.</li>
                <li><em>CTRL + Z</em> - Undo - This will undo the last action performed. For example it can remove a bulk of text that was pasted in the incorrect place. You are not limited to 1 undo at a time. This has uses throughout your OS and on a lot of software.</li>
                <li><em>CTRL + Y</em> - Redo - This will redo an undo action, assuming that no other actions have been performed since the undo. You are not limited to 1 redo at a time. This has uses throughout your OS and on a lot of software.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Windows Functions</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Windows has their own shortcuts that are intended to allow navigating the operating system a lot quicker. Below are a few of the more commonly used functions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>ALT + TAB</em> - Holding <em>ALT</em> and pressing <em>TAB</em> will allow you to switch between apps that are currently open. Release <em>ALT</em> when the desired app is selected. Alternatively you can click on the app of choice to bring it straight up.</li>
                <li><em>WINDOWS + TAB</em> - Same as <em>ALT + TAB</em> but with a few additional functions such viewing the history of previously opened apps, or adding a virtual desktop the separate tasks further.</li>
                <li><em>ALT + F4</em> - Close the active application. This can be disabled by a developer, but is not usually the case outside of games.</li>
                <li><em>CTRL + SHIFT + ESCAPE</em> - Opens up the Windows Task Manager.</li>
                <li><em>WINDOWS + R</em> - Opens up the Windows Run window.</li>
                <li><em>CTRL + ALT + DELETE</em> - Brings up the Windows security menu.</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="picture desktop-image" src="assets/images/security-menu.webp" alt="Windows security menu">

            <h3>Other Useful Shortcuts</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li><em>SHIFT + DELETE</em> - This can be used to permanently delete a selected file while using windows explorer. This skips putting it in the recycle bin so be careful with its use.</li>
                <li><em>WINDOWS + D</em> - Shows the desktop. This is useful if you have a lot of apps open and you don't wish to minimise them all individually.</li>
             <li><em>CTRL + SHIFT + DELETE</em> - Used within browsers to navigated straight to the 'clear browsing data' section.</li>
