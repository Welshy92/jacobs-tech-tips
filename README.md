### Initial Discussion

Windows is an operating system that is used by around [1.4 billion users](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/745681/windows-now-has-1-4-billion-users-but-how-many-are-on-windows-11.html#:~:text=Back%20To%20School-,Windows%20now%20has%201.4%20billion%20users%2C%20but,many%20are%20on%20Windows%2011%3F&text=Windows%2010%20and%20Windows%2011,active%20devices%2C%20Microsoft%20has%20confirmed.) according to an article written by techadvisor, which is a huge majority of desktop/laptop users.

This number has been ever increasing since the initial outbreak of COVID. However a lot of users do not know how to do much more than web browsing or using the specific software assossiated with their jobs because it is not taught to them. This results in them potentially taking longer to do some basic tasks such as moving a block of text from one part of a document to another. The computers themselves will usually have a shorter lifespan as the users are not aware of how to keep it well maintained.

#### Key information for the site

* A list of keyboard shortcuts that will cut down time while performing some basic tasks.
* Useful tips to help maintain your system. These include;
    - Using Windows features such as Windows Defender, Windows Updates, Task manager, Task Scheduler and Defragging.
    - Clearing clutter via File explorer, Web broswers or Add and Remove programs.
    - Backing up files using Physical media or cloud backup such as OneDrive
* A list of useful programs or websites that can add a user to make their life with a computer a bit easier.

### **User Stories**

#### Client Goals

* To be able to view to view the site on a variety of devices.
* To teach users shortcuts to help with work efficiency.
* To show users some basic computer maintainence that will increase the lifespan of their machines.
* To point users towards some software/website that will make their computing experience a bit smoother.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want my time using a computer to be a bit smoother.
* I want to keep my machine performing well for a longer period of time.
* I want to easily navigate the site to find the information I require.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* I want to remind myself of a specific keyboard shortcut quickly.
* I want to remind myself of the steps required to perform certain maintainence operations.
* I want to visit one of the useful websites.

### **Colour Scheme**

I have chosen a colour scheme that is close to the 'classic' Black and green contrast of old computer screens but less of a harsh contrast.
The colour palette was created using the [coolers](https://coolors.co) website.

### **Typography**

[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) was used for the following fonts:
* Inter is used for the headings on the site. It is a sans-serif font.
* Noto Sans is used for the body text on the site. It is a sans-serif font.

### **Imagery**

* Logos used in the 'Useful Sites and Software' were taken from their respective websites. Credits can be found [here](#credits)
* Hero images for index.html and 404.html, as well as the site wide favicon were taking from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com). All images modified by myself. The [license](https://pixabay.com/service/license/) does allow modifications.

### **Features**

The website is made up of 5 pages. The index page, Keyboard Shortcuts, Maintaining Your System, Useful Sites and Software and 404 Error pages. All pages, with the exception of the 404 error page, are accessable from a responsive navigation menu at the top right of the page. To the left of that is the site logo, which will be placed under the navigation menu on smaller screens with a media query. All pages will also contain a footer that displays copyright details, contact information, a link to the sites youtube channel and a 'back to top' link.

The index page is divided into sections. Below the Navigation is a large Hero image taking up the width of the screen. Below that is an introduction to what the site and it's purpose is. Below that is a form that offers a signup to a newsletter.

The Keyboard Shortcuts page contains lists of shortcuts that are divided into different sections, word processing, system navigation and miscellaneous. Each shortcut will show and image of the keys with an explaination of what is achieved by using them, using a GIF to help showcase that if necessary.

The Maintaining your system page if split into a few categories. Keeping your machine fast, decluttering your machine and backing up files. Each section will be split up intoi sub-categories that will walk a user through, step by step, some basic maintainence tasks for their machine.

The Useful Sites and Software page contains a list of websites and software that could potentially aid a user in simplifying some tasks or allowing their system to run better, as well as some common popular pieces that has a variety of sources of information that they can use to help them further. 

The 404 error page will pop up if there is a broken link clicked within the site. It will simply contain a 404 error message and a link back to the homepage.

### **Future Implementations**

### **Accessibility**

While coding this site I have been mindful to ensure that the website is accessible friendly. I have achieved this by:
  * Using semantic HTML
  * Using descriptive alt attributes on images all around the site.
  * Making sure that there is sufficient colour contrast throughout the entire site.
