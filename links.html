        <h2>Useful Sites & Software</h2>
        <p>Below is a list of website and software that I would recommend any person to use on their systems. I believe most of these allow the user to have a better experience when using their systems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.opera.com/gx" target="_blank"><em>Opera GX</em></a> <img class="icon" src="assets/images/opera-icon.png" alt="Opera GX icon"> - A web browser that was designed for gamers first. However it contains some powerful features that all users can benefit greatly from. It is a chromium based browser. You can switch easily from Google Chrome to Opera GX as it can import all of your browsing data and saved passwords. You can also use all of the chrome extensions, ontop of some extensions made specifically for itself. It also has a side bar with integrations for things such as whatsapp, twitter, instagram and many more. It also have a feature that allows you to limit the amount the CPU, memory and bandwidth the browser uses so it doesn't grind you system to a halt like chrome often can.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.win-rar.com/" target="_blank"><em>WinRAR</em></a> <img class="icon" src="assets/images/winrar-icon.png" alt="WinRAR icon"> - A piece of software that can be used to compress files and folders. This is very useful if you have large files that you wish to transfer somewhere else or make avaliable online. You can also password protect the archives it creates within the software to keep it secure.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/" target="_blank"><em>Team Viewer</em></a> <img class="icon" src="assets/images/teamviewer-icon.png" alt="TeamViewer icon"> - A piece of software that allows users to connect to another device that also have the software running. This can be useful if you want to access a computer remotely to perform tasks, or allowing someone to help troubleshoot a problem you are having. <em>(DO NOT GIVE SOMEONE REMOTE ACCESS TO YOUR YOUR COMPUTER UNLESS YOU TRUST THEM.)</em></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.iobit.com/en/advancedsystemcarefree.php" target="_blank"><em>Advanced SystemCare</em> </a><img class="icon" src="assets/images/asc-icon.png" alt="Advanced SystemCare icon"> - A piece of software that you can use to speed up or clean your computer, and protect your private data. Very simple to use and leave on in the background. IOBit, the developer, also have other software that can be installed within it to increase functionality. It contains both free and paid versions.</li>
            <li><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank"><em>OneDrive</em></a> <img class="icon" src="assets/images/onedrive-icon.png" alt="OneDrive Icon"> - A website and piece of software developed by Microsoft that is used for backing up you files to the cloud. The software usually installed onto your Windows OS by default to allow automatic backups of things such as your documents folder. The website is useful to access those files from elsewhere but you can also manually upload files to it.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank"><em>Dropbox</em></a> <img class="icon" src="assets/images/dropbox-icon.png" alt="Dropbox Icon"> - An alternative cloud storage/backup to OneDrive. It also can be used through both the website or software. This is usually a better option for businesses as it offers better admin functionality.</li>
            <li><a href="https://mail.google.com" target="_blank"><em>Gmail</em></a> <img class="icon" src="assets/images/gmail-icon.png" alt="Gmail icon"> -  A website that is an online email application. This is one of the most common apps, alongside Microsoft's Outlook. Gmail is probably the most user friendly application and can easily be used across all of your devices. It is even more handy to have if you own an Android phone.</li>
